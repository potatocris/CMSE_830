# AllLife Bank has a growing customer base. Majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. 
# The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly 
# to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways 
# of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).
# A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. 
# This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.
