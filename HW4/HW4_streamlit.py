         The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly 
         to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways 
         of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).
         A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. 
         This has encouraged the retail marketing department t o devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget."""
